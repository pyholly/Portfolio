      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Born and raised in Portsmouth, I studied music for many years, before
        moving to Cardiff to further my skills at music college. After
        graduation, I spent many years in customer facing roles before deciding
        to travel South East Asia. Amidst experiencing new cultures and
        delicious food, I discovered a passion for coding leading me towards a
        career in tech.

        Upon returning to the UK, I undertook an intensive 13 week Javascript
        Bootcamp with Northcoders where I learnt invaluable skills and
        knowledge. The problem-solving aspect of coding captivated me, and I
        found myself spending countless hours crafting solutions and delving
        into the world of software development.

        In my spare time, you can find me trying out new food spots, tinkering
        on the piano/violin or out and about in nature. I'm excited to connect
        with like-minded individuals who share my curiosity and drive. Let's
        embark on a journey of growth and inspiration together!
